/!\ Warning /!\

Pay attention to the methodology for collecting data : https://www.vgchartz.com/methodology.php

"Since the end of 2018 VGChartz no longer produces estimates for software sales. This is because the high digital market share for software was making it both more difficult to produce reliable retail estimates and also making those estimates increasingly unrepresentative of the wider performance of the games in question. As a result, on the software front we now only record official shipment/sales data, where such data is made available by developers and publishers. The legacy data remains on the site for those who are interested in browsing through it."

## Overview

Welcome to my Video Games Project! 

The purpose of this analysis is to reveal which games are the most popular, the most sales.

The aim of this analysis is to reveal which games are the most popular, the best-selling and the best-rated, by generation (3rd - 9th).

## Project highlights

ðŸ“Œ **Data Preparation:** Rigorously cleaned and prepared the dataset, ensuring data quality and integrity for robust analysis.

ðŸ“Œ **Initial Exploration:** Engaged in initial data exploration during EDA to gain a deep understanding of variables and distributions.

ðŸ“Œ **Data Cleaning:** Employed advanced data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring accuracy in analysis.

ðŸ“Œ **Data Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visualizations, revealing trends in this dataset.

ðŸ“Œ **Meaningful Conclusions:** Derived insights to shed light on artist popularity, scores, sales and correlations between variables.
